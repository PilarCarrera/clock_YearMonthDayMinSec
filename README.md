# clock_YearMonthDayMinSec

I have done this game in the second semester of my first year of university, in a class called Computer Introduction. This class goal was to program the management functions (driver) of the System Timer, managing the interruptions of the Raspberry-Pi in RiscOs, we used a Raspberry Pi 1B+ with a compiler the University of Cantabria provided for their students.
This clock programmed in assembler was my final project of this class. 
Initially you need to introduce an specific year, month, day, hour, minute and second to start with. Once you have done this, the clock would continue by itself, counting the seconds and changing the minutes when getting to 60. The same happens when the minutes get to 60, the hour changes etc.
